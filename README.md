Software for an electromagnetic levitator based on a Hall effect sensor.

## Description
The code implements a PID controller. The process value is read from a Hall effect sensor located below an electromagnet. The magnet output power is controlled by the PID. The result is being able to levitate a permanent magnet below the electromagnet.
